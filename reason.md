This is a personal continuing study of God's word with supplemental information found in the writings of the Spirit of Prophecy. This is here to share that study, one that is a continuing study, that is one that never ends. Use the comments below to further this study. May God bless you as you seek Him.

No one can ever say they have completely studied all aspects of the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy. There are some topics we can be very sure of the understanding. There are others however; that might need further study to understand completely. For example, the Sabbath (the 7th day of the week) is the Lord's Day and the day we are called to worship him. No other day has a blessing from God as this day has, nor the importance this day has. This is firmly presented in the Bible and cannot be disputed without going outside the Bible or using personal desire, wants, or expectations. However, the concept of obedience is one that we have to study deeper to understand to whom we are to obey, why we are to obey, how are we to obey, can we obey, etc. The Bible is clear that  we are to obey, but the devil and theologians are good at confusing us as to what that really means for our daily life. These are just two examples of studies that will take place on this website. One of clear Bible teaching, where there can be no disputing what the Bible says; and one that requires a broader and deeper study of the Bible to fully understand and dispel the confusion surrounding the topic.

### More Information

The way this site is arranged, is that each study is done in a Google document. If you would like to collaborate on a document, you can request to be added to the document and then start making suggestions and comments. Remember, these are studies, not sermons. All studies use the Bible with supplemental information from the Spirit of Prophecy. The information in these studies will most likely change over time. Do not expect that it is static information. As I learn and study, I update the information. This is a place for me to share what I have learned with friends, family, neighbors, and fellow sojourners.
