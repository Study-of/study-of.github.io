What is the Lord's day? Or when is the Sabbath? The current teaching is that the Lord's day is the first day of the week and the Sabbath is Sunday. Can we support this from the Bible? Let us review the passages that deal with Sunday or the first day of the week.

There are 48 references to the first day of the week in the Bible.

1. Reference to the first day as a single day of an evening and morning.
	- Genesis 1:5
2. Reference to the first day of a month.
	- Genesis 8:5, 13
    - Exodus 40:2, 17
    - Leviticus 23:24
    - Numbers 1:1, 18; 7:12; 29:1; 33:38
    - Deuteronomy 1:3
    - 2 Chronicles 29:17
    - Ezra 3:6; 7:9; 10:16-17
    - Nehemiah 8:2
    - Ezekiel 26:1; 29:17; 31:1; 32:1; 45:18
    - Haggai 1:1
3. The eating of unlevend bread for the Feast of Unlevened Bread. The day's of period of seven days are reference here. So this is the first day of that period through the seventh day of that period.
	- Exodus 12:15-16
    - Leviticus 23:7, 35
    - Numbers 28:18
    - Deuteronomy 16:4
    - Matthew 26:17
    - Mark 14:12
4. Special period of Sabbaths that are not part of the weekly cycle. So the first day here is again part of that fiest and so not necessarily the first day of the week.
	- Leviticus 23:39-40
5. Reference to a sequence of events as days. Here is referenced that they are doing on this second day the same as on the first day they did it. Does not imply or suppose that it was Sunday or Monday.
	- Judges 20:22
    - Acts 20:18
6. A period of time.
	- 2 Samuel 21:9 - Reference to the __first days__ is the beginning of a period of time.
    - Nehemiah 8:18 - Reference to the __first day unto the last day__ is the whole period of time.
    - Phillipians 1:5 - Reference to the __first day__ until now as a period of time.
7. Reference to the first day of the week. When the Marys return very early Sunday morning to the place of Christ burial to finish what they could not finish on Friday because of the Sabbath.
	- Matthew 28:1 - In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the **first day** of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
	- Mark 16:1-2 - And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. __2__ And very early in the morning the **first day** of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
    - Luke 24:1 - Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
    - John 20:1 - The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

8. Reference to the first day of the week and the appearance of Christ.
	- Mark 16:9 - Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
    - John 20:19 - Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

9. Reference to the first day of the week. Paul was intending to leave the next day. This next day was Sunday or the first day of the week. A day starts at evening, so for Paul to be preaching until midnight, that would have been the dark part of Sunday with the intention to leave during the light part of Sunday. We know this was the intention since the text reads __ready to depart__ and __continued__.
	- Acts 20:17 - And upon the **first day** of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

10. Reference to collecting offerings on the first day of the week.
	- 1 Corinthians 16:2 - Upon the **first day** of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.

It can be concluded from the referenced texts that none are remotely condoning Sunday worship. If we try to construe the text to meet the desire and support Sunday as the Lord's day, we have to work really hard and be deceptive at doing so at best. The two best texts (points 9 and 10 above) to support this view are ones that show that Paul would have been travelling on Sunday as he left (Acts 20:17) or pass-through (1 Corinthians 16:2). If we then trying (using points 7 and 8 above) to say that His resurrection was the cause of the change, we decieve ourselves as there is no reference or support for this. The rest of the points above (1 through 6) are even less supportive of this idea that the day of worship was changed from Sabbath to Sunday.

It would have been so easy for Christ to have said in thi




The sabbath was institued from the beginning in Eden. Genesis 2 tells of the creating of the Seventh day as a memorial of the creation week and that it is the Lord's day to help us remember the goodness of God. Man had not sinned or fallen short of the glory of God. There was no Jew or Gentile, or Heathan or Isrealite, or Christian, or Protestant. There was Adam and his wife Eve. Created on the 6th literal day and worshiping God on the next day (the seventh day or Sabbath). If God found it neccessary or fit to have a seventh day or sabbath in a perfect world, and then required it to a fallen race, and then it will be celebrated in heaven after Christ's second comming and all things are made new; why would he do away with it for a short time? Why would it for a short period be considered not important? For a God that changes not, who is the same today, yesterday, and tomorrow, it would be very confusing at best to say that this even makes since. It would be more solid a believe that the Sabbath was not changed to Sunday, and we should worship our Creator and Redemer on the seventh day of the week (commonly called Saturday) as His Holy Day the Sabbath.



So John was in the Spirit on the Lord's day (Revelation 1:10). Here we see the reference to Sunday worship? To reach this conclusion, one has to only except mans interpretation of the term __Lord's day__. This term is used only in this one location in the Bible. This term could honestly be interpreted as __the sabbath of the Lord__. And when we search for this term, we find 3 references:
	- Exodus 20:10
    - Leviticus 23:3
    - Deuteronomy 5:14
In these texts we also see that term preceeded by **the seventh day**. The link between the Sabbath and the Lord's day is quit solid when we read scripture. The Lord's day is the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord. Worship Him on His Holy day. Obey his commands and honor him not self. Is it easy to change or follow God's word in this world? No, but that was never a promise. Christ says, "Pickup your cross and follow me". If it was going to be easy, what cross would we be picking up? How would we follow Him?




Still think that it is not important or the evidence is not there to keep the Lord's day holy? Do you still not believe that the seventh day is the sabbath and that we are required to keep it? What if you found that someone else changed it and not God? Would that make a difference? Daniel 7:25 tells that Satan will "... think to change times and laws...." What law of God deals with time? There is only one, the fouth commandment. Who does Satan work through? The Papacy and the Popes of Rome. 



Letter from C.F. Thomas, Chancellor of Cardinal Gibbons on October 28, 1895:

Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her actâ€¦And the act is a MARK of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters.




So there are people that will argue that Sunday is the seventh day of the week since in some countries they have already changed their calendars to support this by starting the week on Monday and ending on Sunday. There are still others that will argue that how can we know what the real seventh day of the week is. Did they not change the calendar in the past and is it not possible that the days of the week are confused over time?

These arguments are easily disproved or dismissed since in nearly all languages of the world, the word for the seventh day of the week (commonly called Saturday in English) is named Sabbath. 

ie: languages that use this term

If the day is called Sabbath and the other six days have names of planets or greek gods or whatever they are named after, it should be quite clear when reading the Bible which day is the seventh.

Furthermore, when we read the Bible and in Revelation the final conflict revolves around worship: worship to God and worship to the beast (that is the papacy, Pope, or Satan); and we find that the Pope of Rome demains Sunday (or the first day of the week) to be sacried and all men to worship that day. Regardless of what calendar you use or where you allow a day to fall on that calendar, it is again quite clear what day of the week is the Sabbath of the Lord our God. The seventh day is the Sabbath and is always followed by the first day (Sunday). If Satan wants your worship on Sunday, then the day before would be Sabbath.

Here we have three quite clear proofs to the student of the Bible that would want to know what day is the Lord's day and when we should be worshiping the Lord.

So does it matter what day? God is really only conserned that we worship Him. The day should not matter so much, right? Well, the short answer is `NO`. The day you worship Him does matter. It does at least two major things by obeying His commands. The first is makes a clear distenction between who you are serving and who everyone else is serving. The second is as to obedience; do you obey God or man?

While it is true that some in true ignorance worship God on the wrong day and in the past and to a lesser degree the present time, God may "wink at their ignorance" (Bible reference); He does not hold all accountable at the same level. Those that are made aware of His truth and willingly ignore or refuse to obey Him show whom they truely serve.
