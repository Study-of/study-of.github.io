Do you not know that you are the temple of God? It follows that as the temple of God that our bodies should be keep undefiled and holy unto Him. We should not put into our body either through eating or drinking or hearing or seeing, we should not even touch something that would defile our body, the temple of God.

When I was in my mid-tweenties, there was a comercial published for some excercise equipment. In the comercial, the man speaking said that he was 40 years old and "in the best shape of his life". He attributed this success to the ownership and use of the excersize equipment that he was using and promoting the sale of. I do not know if he was really in his forties, but I remember thinking to myself at the time, "I am not overweight or generally unhealthy, but I should start now so that I do not get to forty and regret it". I turned 42 last year and was on average (and had been for several years) around 235 with the max weight I ever saw on the scales as 243. Oh, forgive me Lord for defiling your temple.

Interestingly enough, I was able to convence my dad to purchase that excersize equipment and I still have it to this day. It has been setup and setting to be used for the majority of these last 17 years, but is now nicely packed on the highest shelf in the garage. I have a 14-foot ceiling height, so lots of space. If I had to say did it help me with my weight, I would have to say, "obviously not". I never used it but for show how it worked a couple times, and with it being packed on the top shelf for several years and my weight last year reaching the max I ever saw, well, it was useless to have it.

Was the equipment faulty? Was the equipment defective? Did it not work? The answer would have to be no. I would say that is the same response to our spiritual journey. We all have the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy. But without reading and digesting the truth throught the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will gain no benefit. This is not at the fault of the Bible, Spirit of Prophecy, or God Himself, but completely our refusal to respond to the calling of the Holy Spirit. You can read another article, "Obedience"
