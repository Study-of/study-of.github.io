Do you not know that you are the temple of God? It follows that as the temple of God that our bodies should be keep undefiled and holy unto Him. We should not put into our body either through eating or drinking or hearing or seeing, we should not even touch something that would defile our body, the temple of God.

When I was in my mid-tweenties, there was a comercial published for some excercise equipment. In the comercial, the man speaking said that he was 40 years old and "in the best shape of his life". He attributed this success to the ownership and use of the excersize equipment that he was using and promoting the sale of. I do not know if he was really in his forties, but I remember thinking to myself at the time, "I am not overweight or generally unhealthy, but I should start now so that I do not get to forty and regret it". I turned 42 last year and was on average (and had been for several years) around 235 with the max weight I ever saw on the scales as 243. Oh, forgive me Lord for defiling your temple.

Interestingly enough, I was able to convence my dad to purchase that excersize equipment and I still have it to this day. It has been setup and setting to be used for the majority of these last 17 years, but is now nicely packed on the highest shelf in the garage. I have a 14-foot ceiling height, so lots of space. If I had to say did it help me with my weight, I would have to say, "obviously not". I never used it but for show how it worked a couple times, and with it being packed on the top shelf for several years and my weight last year reaching the max I ever saw, well, it was useless to have it.

Was the equipment faulty? Was the equipment defective? Did it not work? The answer would have to be no. I would say that is the same response to our spiritual journey. We all have the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy. But without reading and digesting the truth throught the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will gain no benefit. This is not at the fault of the Bible, Spirit of Prophecy, or God Himself, but completely our refusal to respond to the calling of the Holy Spirit. You can read another article, ["Obedience"](Obedience). In this article, the topic of what it means to obey God are discussed.

Over the years, I did not notice that I was sick. I did not think that I was doing anything "wrong", but knew something was not right. As time passed, and over the last several years (being 2015 to 2018), I could have been quoted as having said, "I feel like an old man" or "I think I am 20, feel like I am 80, but yet I am 40." While I think the first is generalally true of most people, the later should not be of anyone. You should at least feel your age, but that would be dening the power and grace of God. When we obey His commands, we will have an experience that is unlike the world. We will then be able to say, "I feel better then I have ever felt" or "I think AND FEEL like I am 20 yet I am ___."

During this time of feeling like an old man, I hurt. Physically and mentally. I also am quoted as saying, "I can see myself in the future as being a grumpy old man." Oh Lord, please forgive me for blashpeming your name. I would get up from my desk and walk to the door of my office and both hurt (in my back, legs, shoulders, feet, ankles, everywhere it seemed) and be difficult to move. A co-worker and I would walk after lunch together and praise the Lord for him, but he would not be benefited much at all as we walked extremely slow and I would be very sore, even the next day at times. I thought to push the issue and earlier still, another co-worker and I would play Raqcuetball once a week. Well, that was short lived, as I would frequently be still recovering even a week later from playing.

At 240 pounds, that is about 75 pounds overweight. Every time you walk, run, jump, move quickly, or anything, even sitting, you have that extra 75 pounds pounding down on your feet, or weighing down your internal organs. That is alot. When you have the weight on you, you do not think it is significant. I am here to tell you, that it absolutely is. Never let yourself be fooled or miss-lead. Your weight matters. It shortens your life both figurately and literally. Figurately in that you do not have a quality of life and are at many times just sitting and letting time pass (another article on ["Entertainment"](Entertainment)) or literally because your body works harder and thus you die sooner. It degrades your ability of ["Discernment"](Discernment).

In the fall of 2018 an issue at work came to a head (similar to what a valcano does when it erupts). I and a couple other parties at work began having some serious grevenses towards one another. Right and wrong here was not the issues in question. Discernment and the ability to see in others the value that Christ has for man. I am not sure if the others involved see things the same as I do, and that does not matter. I know now, that God allowed me to go through this situation (and I believe of my own making) so that I can see and feel and know the value He has in other. However, the point is, that my health was so poor, that I could not distingish that I was acting similar to the Jewish leaders. I saw no way that I was wrong or that I did anything wrong. I saw that I was right and I was the one wholely wronged in the matter. I was supported by others I respected and this strenghtend me in my resolve. Anyone tring to give me advise or rebuke to my ideals was dismissed or an argument was made to make their statement unjustified. The evedence was strong and clear that the other party was completely and utterly wrong and I was not. I could not be in anyway apart of the cause.

The desire to be right and dismiss the issue was the primary focus. Again, regardless of right and wrong; I was wrong. Even evil or wicked in my thinking and ways. In this and other things I had come to the same behavior as many, name calling. You think oh, what is wrong with that, but we are commanded not to take the name of the Lord in vain [Exodus 20:7]({{biblegateway}}Exodus+20%3A7). How is name calling taking the Lords name in vain? Simple, we are made in the image of God and I claim to be a child of God. As a child of God, I am using his name and acting in a way that is not like Him. And to call something derogatorily or generally to treat someone badly by use of a name that is not theirs or inappropriate, shows our contempt of God Himself and that we are not His. So therefore using His name as ours and spitting on others is breaking the third commandment. There is commentary article on ["The Ten Commandments"](The-Ten-Commandments).

Before I continue, let me just say, I am not perfect now or do I consider myself to ever have been or will be perfect until the Lord comes. I do believe that we are to be perfect in our spheres of influence as Christ said,

We loved with a love that was more than love
But I do not believe we will ever not be able to sin. Read the article on ["Sin No More"](Sin-No-More).
