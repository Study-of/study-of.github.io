Do you not know that you are the temple of God? It follows that as the temple of God that our bodies should be keep undefiled and holy unto Him. We should not put into our body either through eating or drinking or hearing or seeing, we should not even touch something that would defile our body, the temple of God.

When I was in my mid-tweenties, there was a comercial published for some excercise equipment. In the comercial, the man speaking said that he was 40 years old and "in the best shape of his life". He attributed this success to the ownership and use of the excersize equipment that he was using and promoting the sale of. I do not know if he was really in his forties, but I remember thinking to myself at the time, "I am not overweight or generally unhealthy, but I should start now so that I do not get to forty and regret it". I turned 42 last year and was on average (and had been for several years) around 235 with the max weight I ever saw on the scales as 243. Oh, forgive me Lord for defiling your temple.

Interestingly enough, I was able to convence my dad to purchase that excersize equipment and I still have it to this day. It has been setup and setting to be used for the majority of these last 17 years, but is now nicely packed on the highest shelf in the garage. I have a 14-foot ceiling height, so lots of space. If I had to say did it help me with my weight, I would have to say, "obviously not". I never used it but for show how it worked a couple times, and with it being packed on the top shelf for several years and my weight last year reaching the max I ever saw, well, it was useless to have it.

Was the equipment faulty? Was the equipment defective? Did it not work? The answer would have to be no. I would say that is the same response to our spiritual journey. We all have the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy. But without reading and digesting the truth throught the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will gain no benefit. This is not at the fault of the Bible, Spirit of Prophecy, or God Himself, but completely our refusal to respond to the calling of the Holy Spirit. You can read another article, ["Obedience"](Obedience). In this article, the topic of what it means to obey God are discussed.

Over the years, I did not notice that I was sick. I did not think that I was doing anything "wrong", but knew something was not right. As time passed, and over the last several years (being 2015 to 2018), I could have been quoted as having said, "I feel like an old man" or "I think I am 20, feel like I am 80, but yet I am 40." While I think the first is generalally true of most people, the later should not be of anyone. You should at least feel your age, but that would be dening the power and grace of God. When we obey His commands, we will have an experience that is unlike the world. We will then be able to say, "I feel better then I have ever felt" or "I think AND FEEL like I am 20 yet I am ___."

During this time of feeling like an old man, I hurt. Physically and mentally. I also am quoted as saying, "I can see myself in the future as being a grumpy old man." Oh Lord, please forgive me for blashpeming your name. I would get up from my desk and walk to the door of my office and both hurt (in my back, legs, shoulders, feet, ankles, everywhere it seemed) and be difficult to move. A co-worker and I would walk after lunch together and praise the Lord for him, but he would not be benefited much at all as we walked extremely slow and I would be very sore, even the next day at times. I thought to push the issue and earlier still, another co-worker and I would play Raqcuetball once a week. Well, that was short lived, as I would frequently be still recovering even a week later from playing.

At 240 pounds, that is about 75 pounds overweight. Every time you walk, run, jump, move quickly, or anything, even sitting, you have that extra 75 pounds pounding down on your feet, or weighing down your internal organs. That is alot. When you have the weight on you, you do not think it is significant. I am here to tell you, that it absolutely is. Never let yourself be fooled or miss-lead. Your weight matters. It shortens your life both figurately and literally. Figurately in that you do not have a quality of life and are at many times just sitting and letting time pass (Read the article about ["Entertainment"](Entertainment))) or literally because your body works harder and thus you die sooner. It degrades your ability of ["Discernment"](Discernment).

In the fall of 2018 an issue at work came to a head (similar to what a valcano does when it erupts). I and a couple other parties at work began having some serious grevenses towards one another. Right and wrong here was not the issues in question. Discernment and the ability to see in others the value that Christ has for man. I am not sure if the others involved see things the same as I do, and that does not matter. I know now, that God allowed me to go through this situation (and I believe of my own making) so that I can see and feel and know the value He has in other. However, the point is, that my health was so poor, that I could not distingish that I was acting similar to the Jewish leaders. I saw no way that I was wrong or that I did anything wrong. I saw that I was right and I was the one wholely wronged in the matter. I was supported by others I respected and this strenghtend me in my resolve. Anyone tring to give me advise or rebuke to my ideals was dismissed or an argument was made to make their statement unjustified. The evedence was strong and clear that the other party was completely and utterly wrong and I was not. I could not be in anyway apart of the cause.

The desire to be right and dismiss the issue was the primary focus. Again, regardless of right and wrong; I was wrong. Even evil or wicked in my thinking and ways. In this and other things I had come to the same behavior as many, name calling. You think oh, what is wrong with that, but we are commanded not to take the name of the Lord in vain [Exodus 20:7]({{biblegateway}}Exodus+20:7). How is name calling taking the Lords name in vain? Simple, we are made in the image of God and I claim to be a child of God. As a child of God, I am using his name and acting in a way that is not like Him. And to call something derogatorily or generally to treat someone badly by use of a name that is not theirs or inappropriate, shows our contempt of God Himself and that we are not His. So therefore using His name as ours and spitting on others is breaking the third commandment. There is commentary article on ["The Ten Commandments"](The-Ten-Commandments).

Before I continue, let me just say, I am not perfect now or do I consider myself to ever have been or will be perfect until the Lord comes. I do believe that we are to be perfect in our spheres of influence as Christ said,
>
**48** Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
[Matthew 5:48]({{biblegateway}}Matthew+5:48)

But I do not believe we will always be able to sin. Read the article on ["Sin No More"](Sin-No-More).

In December of 2018, I was awakened. Through a sermon I recieved, I realized what, to me had previously gone completely unknown, was happening in the world. I like many other are not conserned with prophecy or caring about our relationship with Christ. We believe that we are fine and need no changes. We like our movies, and tv shows, video games, sports, ambitions, foods, houses, cars, the cares of this live, etc. An article on ["Entertainment"](Entertainment)) goes much deeper into the woes of these things. Because of this sermon and the events at work and the personal struggle in my life I seriously began to search for answers and to prepare for the Lords soon comming. How blind I had been as to the events that had been unfolding and how I was wasting time and not preparing. How I felt much like Christ's diciples after His death as they reflected on His rebuke of them with which the way they thought and treated Mary at Simon's house at the feast he has prepared. We read the account of this in all four gospels, Matthew 10, Mark 14, Luke 19, and John 12. Spirit of Prophecy also comments on this in the Desire of Ages in the chapter The Feast at Simon's House.

It was after this that I started reading and seeking knowledge that I had for such a long time forsacken or neglected or generally thought I already had or knew. In the spring of 2019, the Lord laid on my heart the phrase [Living Sacrific](Living-Sacrfic). For a week, I struggled with this and tring to understand what the meaning of it and how it was significant. Then I came to me, we are the temple of God. The sancuary service and the sacrific without spot or blemish. Now it was starting to make since. We are to defile not the temple of God. We should not put into our body anything that would defile God's temple. Whither it be eating, drinking, watching, smelling, hearing, touching, or otherwise. That day, I made a commitment to God to not defile myself in anyway. I changed my behavior and diet.

I did not change my behavior or diet. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, He is working in me to change these things. The things that have been changed, althought there have been some stumbles along the way, are:
1. Daily Devotion - I make it a point to go before the throne of God daily. First thing in the morning as I find that if I delay or do anything prior to this time with God, I do not have the strength to overcome some challenges. And before the day is closed. I need His watchful care through the night and I desire to have Him on my mind and Him as my thoughts as I go to sleep.
2. Dietary Changes - I make an effort to only eat raw organic fruits, vegitables, grains, and nuts. I do eath some cooked food, but I try not to as far as possible. I absolutely try to stay clear of dairy, eggs, sugar, processed foods, and of course flesh (or animal products of any kind).
3. No Entertainment - Ouch! What? Do not have any fun? This is why Christians are generally considerd to be boring and dule people. It is assumed that if they do not participate in worldly entertainment then they do not and cannot have fun. Again read the article on ["Entertainment"](Entertainment)). The short of it for this testimony is that entertainment as the world defines it is evil and devilish and will bring you down and you will end up losing your place in heaven if you cannot part from it. Yes this is harsh. The reality is even harsher. There is a war going on over yours and my soles. Control of your mind is one central them of this war. Without proper health, you loose ["Discernment"](Discernment) and entertianment also has the same effect. I play Raquectball with some friends once or twice a week. We play by the rules, but never keep score. Every week we win the game more and more. As I write this, two days ago, we had one of the best games where we had some of the best vollys ever. Everyone came out sweeting and excited and talking about the moments in the game and no one felt put down or shamed. We all three won.
4. Watch the Mouth - I willingly try to pay attention to how I refer to people and issues. Thinking of people as God's lost children and not some demon or permenently lost sole. Christ came to die for **_ALL_**. That word is to small, which is why I think the Jews and Adventist and God's people miss it so frequently. But He came to save all, that none should parish.
>
**10** For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
**11** And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
[Luke 19:10-11]({{biblegateway}}Luke+19:10-11)

Since this time, the Lord has blessed. While I have in the past tried to do this and that to lose weight, it never stuck and I quickly feel back and ultimately gained more then I had before. It is not much unlike the story Christ tells of the Demon He evects, who comes again to possess the individual finds the man clean and empty and invides 7 unclean spirits to join him and the individual is left worse than before.
>
**24** When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
**25** And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
**26** Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
[Luke 11:24-26]({{biblegateway}}Luke+11:24-26)

This has been different, although I did not know it at the time. This was a commitment to God and my body was the sacrific. I do not have the authority to eat and drink and do with my body as I want. I gave that to God to use. I have to obey His will in how and what I do with the body He has lent me to use. I have through His strength been able to walk by the donuts at work and desire none where before I would eat more than one and think nothing of it. I walk past the frided food and reject the processed veggie meats. I strive only to purchase organic food so as not to polute my body with strange organizems that are plaguing society. If you do not believe that it matters, read this article on ["OrganicFoods"](Organic-Foods).

Today, I am weighting myself on average each day at 185 lbs. Oddly enough this was my goal for several years. Earlier this year, I was in conversation with a co-worker and found that he and I are of the same build and height. He is around the 165 lbs. mark and this has cause me early this year, to change my goal to 165 lbs. This means I have 20 more to go. I am excited to see what an additional weight lose can do. When I would play raqcuetball at 215 lbs, it was fun, but I would be sore the next day and I could feel the pressure on my feet, but stil was no where near as bad as serveral years back as I mentioned earlier in the testimony. When I go to 205 lbs., it was even better, but still had issues. When I dropped below 200 lbs. it has been a game changer (the pun is intended here). I feel like when I am on the court to be a 20 year old (remember my comment from earlier). One of my co-workers I have played the longest with, has commented that he has had to up his game to keep up with me sometimes. When I leave the court and before I get home, I have nearly fully recovered and ready to go play again. Remember I said it would take more then a week to recover before? For the last few times we have played, I have started running to the court from my office rather than walk. Gets the heart rate up faster and I try to during the first have go as hard out as I can. I would never have believed this was really possible. The Lord is good.

This is what has happened in my life thus far. But as I said, I still have a ways to go with the weight, but I still have even further to go in my relationship with Christ. If you ever feel that it cannot be done, let me say, put your faith and trust in God. He will make the impossible possible. Two years ago, when I desired to start this journey I failed. I had even gained weight. I still felt last year that it was possible, but did not truely believe. When I gave up tring to benefit and lose the weight for selfish reasons, and committed my body to God, that is when things changed and there has not been a desire to look back. That is not to say that the things I left behind have not tried to return, but God has given me the strenth to come to Him each day and seek His forgiveness and accept that He has forgiven.

As I continue on this journey, may I invite you to join me and God as we seek to be one together. Now is the time to get down on your knees and pray for the string of Christ for tomorrow may never come. If you feel your are struggling, then before you get our of bed in the morning, go before the throne of God and ask for His help and strength. The great thing about our Lord and Savior is that we can go before His throne anytime anywhere. We do not have to do special ritual or voodoo or dance or whatever the world teaches. We just on our knees if possible present ourselves to God in prayer. If you do not know how to pray, then talk to God as though He is there next to you as a friend and He will be there next to you as a friend listening and conforting you. You are never so far gone or so far lost or degraded or done anything that that you cannot approach the throne of God to seek Him.

May God bless you on your sojourn through this world into the kingdom of God.
