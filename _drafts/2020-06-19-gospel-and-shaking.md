**The Gospel**

John the Baptist taught, "Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand".
Matthew 3:2

Christ began His teaching with, "Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand".
Matthew 3:17

**The Shaking**

> I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against it, and this is what will cause a shaking among God's people. - CET 176.1
> I saw that the testimony of the True Witness has not been half heeded. The solemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church hangs has been lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded. This testimony must work deep repentance; all who truly receive it will obey it, and be purified. - CET 176.2

**The Seal**

> (Revelation 7:2.) Seal Is a Settling Into Truth—Just as soon as the people of God are sealed in their foreheads—it is not any seal or mark that can be seen, but a settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be moved—**just as soon as God's people are sealed and prepared for the shaking, it will come**. Indeed, it has begun already; the judgments of God are now upon the land, to give us warning, that we may know what is coming (Manuscript 173, 1902). -4BC 1161.1
