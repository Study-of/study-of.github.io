**The Gospel**

John the Baptist taught, "Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand".
Matthew 3:2

Christ began His teaching with, "Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand".
Matthew 3:17

**The Shaking**

> I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against it, and this is what will cause a shaking among God's people. - CET 176.1
> I saw that the testimony of the True Witness has not been half heeded. The solemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church hangs has been lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded. This testimony must work deep repentance; all who truly receive it will obey it, and be purified. - CET 176.2

**The Seal**

> (Revelation 7:2.) Seal Is a Settling Into Truth—Just as soon as the people of God are sealed in their foreheads—it is not any seal or mark that can be seen, but a settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be moved—**just as soon as God's people are sealed and prepared for the shaking, it will come**. Indeed, it has begun already; the judgments of God are now upon the land, to give us warning, that we may know what is coming (Manuscript 173, 1902). -4BC 1161.1

"The Spirit of Prophecy" "Treasure Chest"


If it is of God, then it is His. Or, it is not. God is powerful enough to influence as He sees fit, and when He leads, He will surely lead.


**Grieving the Spirit**
When we disregard God's word/leading, we remove His "ability" to lead (give visions and dreams). If we expect to have Him lead us, we might want to obey the councel that He has given and share that councel with others and do this without shame or fear.


**Ellen White on Revised Versions**
Do not edit/revise the word of God or those that wrote under inspiration His thoughts and ideas.

> They come to me, those that are copying my writings, and say, “Now here is the better revised words, and I think I will put that in.” Don’t you change one word, not a word. The revised edition we do not need at all. We have got the word that Christ has spoken Himself and given us. And don’t you in my writings change a word for any revised edition. There will be revised editions, plenty of them, just before the close of this earth’s history, and I want all my workers to understand, and I have got quite a number of them. I want them to understand that they are never to take the revised word, and put it in the place of the plain, simple words just as they are. They think they are improving them, but how do they know but that they may switch off on an idea, and give it less importance than Christ means them to have. -22LtMs, Ms188, 1907, par. 26
