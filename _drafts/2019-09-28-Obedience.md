The idea of obedience flys straight in the face of free willed people. Especially those of use that are not familiar with living under a monarchy or oppressive government. All throughout the Bible we are called to **_OBEDIENCE_**. Sense **_OBEDIENCE_** is required, we should answer some questions before we just straight up dismiss it as not possible or undesirable. Let us answer the following questions:
1. What or who should we commit **_OBEDIENCE_** to?
2. Why should we be willing or want (or desire) to give **_OBEDIENCE_**?
3. Are we we able and how can we fulfill the level of **_OBEDIENCE_** required?

## What or who should we commit **_OBEDIENCE_** to?**

The answer to this question is clear. 

> 
**4** Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
[Deuteronomy 13:4]({{biblegateway}}Deuteronomy+13:4)






The Bible is clear that we are to obey, but the devil and theologians are good at confusing us as to what that really means for our daily life.

When Christ presented to the Isrealites at Mount Sinai, they where instructed to obey and keep His commandments, statues, and ordinences. We know from history, that they did not keep them. The Isreal nation was consistently falling into idolitry. For such, Jerusalem was destroyed along with the temple and nearly all of the nation was taken captive to Babylon. You might also think, are we not save by Christ's sacrifice and His eternal grace? Are we not told that nothing we do can save us? While these are true, what is lost in these and other questions similar, is that God did tell us to obey and do his commandments.

So if God has told us to "do", that implies that we "can" and "should" obey. What does that mean? That I do not murder people? Well, yes! But that is not all it means. Because we are told by Christ Himself, that murder is not just the actual act of taking someone's life. Christ even goes on to say that if you have an issue with your "brother" you should reconcile with him before coming to the Lord.
